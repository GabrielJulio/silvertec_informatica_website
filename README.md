  I had experiences with programming before, but at the very start of 2019 it was when I've decided to be a programmer and
   focused my studies on software development, and already on November of the same year I saw the first news about the virus
    that now we know as COVID-19 and realized that I should get a job before it got spread.
  
  I **THOUGHT** I knew enough to be a mid-level developer and decided to be a developer on the ​​health area, eg: hospitals.
  So I applied to a job in **IntMed** and they gave me this test and for some reason I thought I had passed... completed every
   mandatory requirement and made some of the optionals.
  
  I still can remeber the poor code, that I made some people believe that I was what I thoutght I was. Now I can only image
   their side... the impression they had of me: a liar.
  
  Today I started to develop this project, from zero, just to make me feel better for one more day.
  
  Currently I work with Rails, but I'll do with Django as was the test.

  I love Flutter, but I'll do with Angular just as it was in the test.

  I know little about unit tests, but I'll do both frontend and backend with unittests.

  I'll dockerize it too.

### In Progress
  - Backend
### Todo
